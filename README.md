FiioE10Fixer
============

FiioE10Fixer is an OS X tool that helps to overcome some issues that your Fiio E10 might have.

## What are those issues?

Some devices (if not all) are known to have some audio problems:

1. Popping noises mainly when going from silence to sound and vice versa.
2. Tiny extra silence when going from silence to sound that cuts the beginning of songs and sound effects.

## How does this tool help me fix that?

Actually this is not a fix, but a way to overcome those problems by tricking the device into keeping a playing state forever. It constantly loops a wave file in background containing just silence (FF hex values). That way it manages to keep the device always active but without making any real sound at all.

## But won't this break my Fiio E10?

I have no idea! That's why ***you must use this tool completely at your own risk***. I've been using mine this way for about 4 months now and nothing happened.

## Cool, I will use it at my own risk. Now give me the download link!

Ok, here you are: https://sourceforge.net/projects/fiioe10fixer/

I hope it helps somebody out there, as it helped me, to get the best sound from this cool little device.
